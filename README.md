```yaml
{
    ...
    "fixture": {...},
    "response": [
        {
            ...
            "bookmakers": [
                {
                    "id": Bookmaker ID (e.g. 12),
                    "name": Bookmaker Name (e.g. "Betfair"),
                    "bets": [
                        {
                            "id": Bet Type ID (e.g. 1),
                            "name": Bet Type Name (e.g "Match Winner"),
                            "values": [
                                {
                                    "value": What the bet is being placed on (e.g "Home"),
                                    "odd": The odds for this bet (e.g "2.35")
                                },
                                {},{},{},,,{}
                            ]
                        },
                        {},{},{},,,{}
                    ]
                },
                {},{},{},,,{}
            ]
        },
        {},{},{},,,{}
    ]
}

## Arbitrage Betting Calculator
### Accepted input format
The arbitrage betting calculator will accept data in a similar format as laid out above. However it will only accept one element from "response" at a time and only the "bookmaker" data. Also additional perimeters can be added (see below).
```yaml
{
    "bookmakers": [
        {
            "id": Bookmaker ID (e.g. 12),
            "name": Bookmaker Name (e.g. "Betfair"),
            "bets": [
                {
                    "id": Bet Type ID (e.g. 1),
                    "name": Bet Type Name (e.g "Match Winner"),
                    "max_bet": "235.12"                 // How much money is available in this website, or how much you are willing to bet (default=1000)
                    "values": [
                        {
                            "value": What the bet is being placed on (e.g "Home"),
                            "odd": The odds for this bet (e.g "2.35"),
                            "lay": true,                // if this is a lay bet (default: false)
                            "volume": "52.12",          // the maximum amount that can be placed on this bet (default: infinite, will be limited by the sites "max_bet")
                            "already placed": "15",     // acts as a minimum amount that can be placed on this bet (default: 0)
                        },
                        {},{},{},,,{}
                    ]
                },
                {},{},{},,,{}
            ]
        },
        {},{},{},,,{}
    ]
}
```
### Response format
The calculator will return the information in the same format that it received it with some additional parameters added. Note: only the data for the bets which money should be placed on will be returned
```yaml
{
    "total bet size": 3250,       // the total amount of money to be placed on bets
    "profit": 1565,               // the expected profit from these bets
    "slack": 0.05,                // the variation in potential profit dependant on the outcome
    "no. bets": 8,                // How many bets are needed to be placed
    "bookmakers": [
        {
            "id": Bookmaker ID (e.g. 12),
            "name": Bookmaker Name (e.g. "Betfair"),

                        },
                        {},{},{},,,{}
                    ]
                },
                {},{},{},,,{}
